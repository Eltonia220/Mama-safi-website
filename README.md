## 💼 Project Background

This was my first freelance web development project, created for a family-owned eldercare business in Finland. The client required:

- Bilingual support (Finnish and English)
- Two different pricing tiers based on client type
- Professional, trustworthy design for elderly clients
- Easy contact and booking functionality

## 🎯 Key Challenges Solved

1. **Bilingual Implementation**: Created a custom language switcher that changes all content without page reload
2. **Dynamic Pricing**: Built a dropdown system that switches service names, descriptions, and prices based on client type
3. **Accessibility**: Large fonts, high contrast, and simple navigation for elderly users
4. **Domain Integration**: Successfully connected custom Finnish domain to Netlify hosting

## 📝 What I Learned

- Client communication and requirement gathering
- Bilingual website architecture
- Custom JavaScript for dynamic content switching
- DNS configuration and domain management
- Professional pricing and project scoping
